No changes to quantitative, fundamental, or technical views.

8/31/2021

No changes to the equity views.
The economic data (especially consumer related) has been coming in a bit softer vs expectation, but still points to stable/stabilizing economy. Supply challenges in auto related semiconductors has been straining the sector.
Major regional equity indexes remain range-bound (and going sideways) while US Large Cap continued upward movement amid low(er) volatility. 
The quant scores for the US, EM, and US Small cap regime models have not changed. EAFE improved a bit as Systemic Stress Indicator recovered. The currency and technical attractiveness vs US are still negative. The Value stocks in EAFE and EM seemed to be more attractive relative to the US Value.
Dovish Fed and worries about reduction in stimulus and Covid developments continued driving a game of tag between the reflation trade (Value) and longer-duration/organic Growth Quality stocks. From a relative strength perspective Quality have been making consistent gains (see Equity Factors > Relative Strength).
Equity Premia (Fed Model) remains positive.
The narrative has been increasingly calling for a correction in US equities by the year-end, which is not surprising given a seven-months of market gains.

No changes to the views.
Consumer related economic data has been coming in a bit softer over the week with consumer sentiment and retail sales lagging expectations. At the same time, PPI and manufacturing indicators remained strong. Covid Delta variant and higher prices are reasonable drivers explaining hesitant consumer. The consumer financial health remains robust with reasonable growth in credit and low delinquencies. 
US Large caps and EAFE posted modest gains while US Small caps and EMs declined. The USD edged higher. Oil was flat while Gold posted solid gains.
My assessment of technicals remains the same: range bound.

8/10/2021

No changes to the views amid a very uneventful week.
Economic data continues to provide a stable backdrop for equities which is evident in solid ISM & Markit PMIs (both services and manufacturing), durable goods orders, and consumer confidence and job openings.
The equity premium (earnings yield) had been gradually improving since March lows as corporate earnings have been coming in stronger than expected (Fed Model chart).
My assessment of technicals remains the same: range bound.
S&P 500 is toying with resistance around 4400, Small Caps are stuck mid-range between 2130sh and 2330sh, and EAFE and EM are trending sideways as improving USD may have dampened their bounce off end-of July lows.
Trading volumes have been lower (maybe seasonal) and Wall Street strategists are more optimistic about the second half of the year as Delta variant fears subside, inflation persists, and economic growth/recovery continues. 
RS Models: REITs => US => LC => US SC => EAFE


8/3/2021

Fresh concerns about China technology clampdown, Delta variant, short-term volatility in oil and USD on a backdrop of solid corporate earnings and supportive economic data kept market range bound.
Regime Models scores remained unchanged.
Relative Strength: REITs>S&P500>EAFE>R2K  
EAFE moved up a spot yesterday. A short-term improvement in EAFE momentum coincided with decline in USD. 

7/26/2021

The proverbial wall of worry is becoming thicker as regulatory pressure by Chinese government on certain domestic sectors has been added by financial press 
to the drivers of market sentiment. Covid Delta variant remains on top of mind as it has been driving ebb and flow of government's responses.
My assessment of technicals remains intact from the last week, except that EM index went through support level amid developments in China.
Economic data over the last week came in without major surprises. Price increases in certain areas of the economy dampened demand (like home sales) which follows a basic economic theory of elasticity of demand.
Corporate earnings have been coming in very strong and companies are raising forward guidance. Discussion of supply chain issues seemed to be a common thread underlying existing conditions.
Currency composite in EAFE and EM models remained a headwind amid continuous strengthening of USD and weakness in AUD.
The technicals are weaker in the US model as raising inter-stock correlations, declining (hovers around 50) market breadth, and increasing short-term volatility point to near-term stresses.


7/20/2021

Despite recent volatility US equity markets remained with trading bands established this year. S&P stayed withing an upward sloping channel while Russell 2000 continues moving sideways having tested support at 2130sh.
EAFE and EM have been going sideways for a while and don't look healthy to me, especially EAFE.
The models have also reflected recent range bound turbulence. Small vs Large switched to preference for large and US regime model went down two points: correlations within stocks have been increasing and
our currency proxy for global growth (AUD/CHF) is probably reflecting uneven recovery and growth concerns. The currency signal also impacted EAFE and EM scores as weaker AUD/CHF coincided with stronger USD.
The Eurozone Systemic Stress Indicator have been increasing (negative dynamic) and further impacted the EAFE regime score.
It is no surprise that Quality style have been gaining in relative strength given heightened volatility.
About 10% of the S&P 500 constituents have reported earnings thus far. The numbers are solid in both Growth and Positive Surprises.
Economic data still points to continuing recovery although concern are mounting (in narrative) of slowing global economic growth amid Covid (variant D) developments.



6/28/2021

The views remain unchanged. 

Economic data remains constructive without major surprises either way. The biggest standout was today's Conference Board Consumer Confidence which came in at 127.3 vs 119 forecast.
Shortage of labor and supply chain issues continue to apply upward pressure on prices. The COVID Delta variant outbreaks may temper economic reopening and certain areas but unlikely 
to have a major impact (at least given currently available information). The path to recovery from the pandemic seemed to be more curtain in the US vs the rest of the world.
The US Small cap, EAFE, and EM indexes remain range-bound while S&P 500 broke through during the week amid low volatility and decline in market breadth.
The equity premium over cash and bonds (Fed Model) remains attractive. 

 
Relative Strength Ranking

US Sml Cap -> REITS -> S&P 500

US Factors: favors cyclical exposures: Sentiment -> Value -> Momentum (currently in procyclical names, mainly Energy). However, Quality have been gaining momentum of the last month.

Regime Models

US Large & Small caps are both in risk on. The Small Cap score, at this point, is only marginally favorable relative to LC.
EM: The overall model is Risk-on. The concerns are mainly in the currency composite, as USD is getting stronger and attractiveness of commodity based currencies vs defensive one is losing momentum.
EAFE: The overall model is Risk-on and the only possible areas of weakness are relative to the US, in currency and momentum terms.


6/22/2021

No changes from last weeks.

While CPI, PPI, and export/import prices all came in slightly higher than expected, weekly earnings, retail sales, housing starts and building permits lagged expectations.
The data still points to supply driven constrains amid COVID related disruptions. Despite a slight elevation in volatility over the last few day, equity indexes remain range-bound.
Valuations remain elevated relative to historical averages but are still attractive via bonds (Fed Model). REITs moved into the first spot on the relative strength rank (US Small caps moved from #1 to #2) while
Value and Sentiment (risk) remained in the first two spots in the US. A seasonal weakness in Small Caps paired with bumpy recovery in employment and increased short-term volatility support neutral stance in allocation to equities.

6/8/2021


No changes from last week.

US personal spending rose at a moderate pace following stimulus fueled surge and the slowdown could have been reflective of faster inflation. All is still consistent with sustained economic growth. The ISM gauge of manufacturing activity and Markit US Services PMI improved in May amid stronger orders growth and opening of the economy. Increase in orders, along with manufacturing backlogs and longer delivery times indicate continuous supply chain difficulties and short supply of skilled labor.
The US equity markets are at the upper level of the recent channels and MSCI EAFE has broken through. EAFE looks attractive on the technical level amid consistent short-mid-term momentum while still lagging the rest on relative strength longer term.
Valuations remain elevated relative to historical averages but are still attractive via bonds (Fed Model).

5/25/2021

No changes from last week.

Economic releases over the past week continue to support robust post-pandemic recovery. Both Markit US Manufacturing and Services PMIs point to economic growth with Services PMI beating expectations (70.1 vs 64.3).
Inflation remains a hot topic but it is not playing into my thoughts on positioning yet. As I’ve mention before the expectation is for the markets to remain range-bound, and they did during the last week.
The market leadership has been broad, despite shifting back and forth between cyclical, Growth, and sometime defensives.  It remained a good environment for active managers.

5/18/2021

No changes from the last week. The quantitative models remain risk-on given lack of major activity on economic, technicals and valuation fronts. 
The major equity indexes appear to have been range bound which continue to align with our thesis of neutral positioning across.
The Value Indexes in Small Caps and Non-US, as well as S&P 500, look more attractive on relative basis through the lens of a composite score on Technicals. Valuation, Volatility, Quality and Growth. 
This measure is outside of the scope of the Regime models and serves as a reasonable descriptor of the current state. 
The other descriptor of relative attractiveness of equities vs bonds, the Fed Model improved a bit over the past week amid weaker equity prices and strong earnings season.

5/10/2021
Quantitative signals across model remain supportive of equities. However, given a slew of uncertainties related to the path of COVID recovery, supply chain inflationary pressures, and impact of fiscal stimulus are all causes of concern and warrant a pause in pro-cyclical view. 
The PM view on equities is neutral across the board which implies holding equity allocation at or close to policy weights.
