The proverbial wall of worry is becoming thicker as regulatory pressure by Chinese govenment on certain domestic sectors has been added by financial press 
to the drivers of market sentiment. Covid Delta variant remains on top of mind as it has been driving ebb and flow of government's responces.
My assesment of technicals remains intact from the last week, except that EM index went through support level amid developments in China.
Economic data over the last week came in without major suprices. Price increases in certain areas of the economy dampend demand (like home sales) which follows a basic economic theory of elasticity of demand.
Corporate earnings have been coming in very strong and companies are raising forward guidence. Discussion of supply chain issues seemed to be a common thread undelying existing conditions.
Currency composite in EAFE and EM models remained a headwind amid continuous strenthening of USD and weaknes in AUD.
The technicals are weaker in the US model as raising inter-stock correlations, declining (hovers around 50) market breadth, and increasing short-term volatility point to near-term stresses.

Despite recent voaltility US equity markets remained with trading bandds established this year. S&P stayed withing an upward sloping channel  while Russell 2000 continues moving sideways having tested support at 2130sh.
EAFE and EM have been going sideways for a while and don't look healthy to me, especialy EAFE.
The models have also reflected recent range bound turbulance. Small vs Large swithched to preferrence for large and US regime model went down two points: correlations within stocks have been increasing and
our currency proxy for global growth (AUD/CHF) is probably reflecting uneven recovery and growth concerns. The currency signal also impacted EAFE and EM scores as weaker AUD/CHF coinsided with stronger USD.
The Eurozone Systemic Stress Indicator have been increasing (negative dynamic) and further impacted the EAFE regime score.
It is no suprice that Quality style have been gaining in relative strenght given hightened volatility.
About 10% of the S&P 500 constituents have reported earnings thusfar. The numbers are solid in both Growth and Positive Surprices.
Economic data still points to continuing recovery although concern are mounting (in narrative) of slowing global economic growth amid Covid (variant D) developments.



6/28/2021

The views remain unchanged. 

Economic data remains constractive without major surprises either way. The biggest standout was today's Conference Board Consumer Confidence which came in at 127.3 vs 119 forcast.
Shortage of labour and supply chain issues continue to apply upward pressure on prices.The COVID Delta variant outbreaks may temper economic reopening and certain areas but unlikely 
to have a major impact (at least given currently available information). The path to recovery from the pandemic seemed to be more curtain in the US vs th erest of the world.
The US Small cap, EAFE, and EM indexes remain range-bound while S&P 500 broke through during the week amid low volatillity and decline in market breadth.
The equity premium over cash and bonds (Fed Model) remains attractive. 

 
Relative Strenth Ranking

US Sml Cap -> REITS -> S&P 500

US Factors: favors cyclical exposures: Sentiment -> Value -> Momentum (currently in procyclical names, mainly Energy). However, Qualilty have been gaining momentum of the last month.

Regime Models

US Large & Small caps are both in risk on. The Small Cap score, at this point,  is only marginaly favorable relative to LC.
EM: The overall model is Risk-on. The concerns are mainly in the currency composite, as USD is getting stronger and attractivness of commodity based currences vs defensive one is losing momentum.
EAFE:The overall model is Risk-on and the only possibel areas of weakness are relative to the US, in currency and momentum terms.


6/22/2021

No changes from last weeks.

While CPI, PPI, and expost/import prices all came in slightly higher than expected, weekly earnings, retail sales, housing starts and building permits lagged expectations.
The data still points to supply driven constrains amid COVID related distruptions. Despite a slight elevation in volatility over the last few day, equity indexes remain range-bound.
Valuations remain elevated relative to historical averages but are still attractive via bonds (Fed Model). REITs moved into the first spot on the relative strenght rank (US Small caps moved from #1 to #2) while
Value and Sentiment (risk) remained in the first two spots in the US. A seasonal weakness in Small Caps paired with bumpy recovery in employment and increased short-term volatility support neutral stance in allocation to equities.

6/8/2021


No changes from last week.

US personal spending rose at a moderate pace following stimulus fueled surge and the slowdown could have been reflective of faster inflation. All is still consistent with sustained economic growth. The ISM gauge of manufacturing activity and Markit US Services PMI improved in May amid stronger orders growth and opening of th eeconomy. Increase in orders, along with manufacturing backlogs and longer delivery times indicate continuous supply chain difficulties and short supply of skilled labor.
The US equity markets are at the upper level of the recent channels and MSCI EAFE has broken through. EAFE looks attractive on th etechniocal level amid consistent short-mid-term momentum momentum while still lagging the rest on relative strenght longer term.
Valuations remain elevated relative to historical averages but are still attractive via bonds (Fed Model).

5/25/2021

No changes from last week.

Economic releases over the past week continue to support robust post-pandemic recovery. Both Markit US Manufacturing and Services PMIs point to economic growth with Services PMI beating expectations (70.1 vs 64.3).
Inflation remains a hot topic but it is not playing into my thoughts on positioning yet. As I’ve mention before the expectation is for the markets to remain range-bound, and they did during the last week.
The market leadership has been broad, despite shifting back and forth between cyclical, Growth, and sometime defensives.  It remained a good environment for active managers.

5/18/2021

No changes from the last week. The quantitative models remain risk-on given lack of major activity on economic, technicals and valuation fronts. 
The major equity indexes appear to have been range bound which continue to align with our thesis of neutral positioning across.
The Value Indexes in Small Caps and Non-US, as well as S&P 500, look more attractive on relative basis through the lens of a composite score on Technicals. Valuation, Volatility, Quality and Growth. 
This measure is outside of the scope of the Regime models and serves as a reasonable descriptor of the current state. 
The other descriptor of relative attractiveness of equities vs bonds, the Fed Model improved a bit over the past week amid weaker equity prices and strong earnings season.

5/10/2021
Quantitative signals across model remain supportive of equities. However, given a slew of uncertainties related to the path of COVID recovery, supply chain inflationary pressures, and impact of fiscal stimulus are all causes of concern and warrant a pause in pro-cyclical view. 
The PM view on equities is neutral across the board which implies holding equity allocation at or close to policy weights.
