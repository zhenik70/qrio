No changes from last week.
US personal spending rose at a moderate pace following stimulus fueled surge and the slowdown could have been reflective of faster inflation. All is still consistent with sustained economic growth. The ISM gauge of manufacturing activity improved in May amid stronger orders growth. Increase in orders, along with manufacturing backlogs and longer delivery times indicate continuous supply chain difficulties and short supply of skilled labor.

No changes from last week.
Economic releases over the past week continue to support robust post-pandemic recovery. Both Markit US Manufacturing and Services PMIs point to economic growth with Services PMI beating expectations (70.1 vs 64.3).
Inflation remains a hot topic but it is not playing into my thoughts on positioning yet. As I’ve mention before the expectation is for the markets to remain range-bound, and they did during the last week.
The market leadership has been broad, despite shifting back and forth between cyclical, Growth, and sometime defensives.  It remained a good environment for active managers.

No changes from the last week. The quantitative models remain risk-on given lack of major activity on economic, technicals and valuation fronts. 
The major equity indexes appear to have been range bound which continue to align with our thesis of neutral positioning across.
The Value Indexes in Small Caps and Non-US, as well as S&P 500, look more attractive on relative basis through the lens of a composite score on Technicals. Valuation, Volatility, Quality and Growth. 
This measure is outside of the scope of the Regime models and serves as a reasonable descriptor of the current state. 
The other descriptor of relative attractiveness of equities vs bonds, the Fed Model improved a bit over the past week amid weaker equity prices and strong earnings season.

Quantitative signals across model remain supportive of equities. However, given a slew of uncertainties related to the path of COVID recovery, supply chain inflationary pressures, and impact of fiscal stimulus are all causes of concern and warrant a pause in pro-cyclical view. 
The PM view on equities is neutral across the board which implies holding equity allocation at or close to policy weights.
